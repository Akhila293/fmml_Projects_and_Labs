This approach helps reduce the impact of randomness in the data splitting process and provides a more stable estimate of a model's performance on unseen data. It can also provide a more accurate estimate of test accuracy because it helps account for variations in the training data."

However, it's essential to understand that even with increased iterations, this approach cannot completely compensate for the limitations of an extremely small dataset.  When dealing with small training datasets, the model's ability to capture meaningful patterns is severely hard due to the lack of diverse data. In such scenarios, no amount of additional iterations can fully address the fundamental issue of insufficient data."
